# EchoSphere Authentication Changes

## Overview

The EchoSphere application has been simplified by removing social login functionality and keeping only the traditional username/password authentication system. This document explains the changes that were made and provides guidance on how to work with the updated authentication system.

## Changes Made

1. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Simplified the `SocialLogin.jsx` component to show only a "Secure Authentication" message
   - Removed social login buttons from the Login and Register pages
   - Updated the OAuthCallback.jsx page to redirect users to the login page
   - Removed references to social login throughout the frontend

2. **Backend Changes**:
   - Removed Passport.js and related dependencies
   - Removed social authentication routes (Google, GitHub, Facebook)
   - Removed session handling which was primarily used for social login
   - Added fallback route for legacy social login requests
   - Removed social authentication controllers

3. **Dependency Changes**:
   - Removed these packages from server dependencies:
     - passport
     - passport-facebook
     - passport-github2
     - passport-google-oauth20
     - express-session

## Current Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: Users register with a username, email, and password
2. **Login**: Users log in with their username and password
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens are used for maintaining user sessions
4. **Logout**: Users can securely log out from their account

## Benefits of This Simplification

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler authentication system with fewer moving parts
2. **Improved Reliability**: Less dependency on third-party services
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Simplified codebase that's easier to maintain and update
4. **Faster Loading**: Reduced bundle size by removing unused social login code

## Restoring Social Login (If Needed in Future)

If social login functionality needs to be restored in the future:

1. Reference the backup files with `.removed` extension
2. Reinstall the required dependencies
3. Restore the Passport.js configuration
4. Restore the social authentication routes and controllers
5. Update the frontend components to include social login buttons
