# EchoSphere Code Cleanup Report

## Changes Made for Deployment Preparation:

### 1. Removed Redundant Files:
- Deleted `userControllerExtensions.js` since all functionality was already in `userController.js`

### 2. Fixed Import Issues:
- Removed unused imports `deleteMessageRoute` and `deleteAllMessagesRoute` in ChatContainer.jsx

### 3. Fixed React useEffect Warnings:
- Added missing `navigate` dependencies to useEffect hooks in:
  - Login.jsx
  - Register.jsx

### 4. Removed Debug Code:
- Removed console.log statements in SetAvatar.jsx

### 5. Fixed Unused Variable Warning:
- Fixed the unused `imgLoaded` variable in SetAvatar.jsx

### 6. Fixed Accessibility Issues:
- Added proper href values to links in Register.jsx (replaced empty # hrefs)

## Recommendations for Future Improvements:

1. Fix remaining React Hook exhaustive-deps warnings in components
2. Optimize image assets for faster loading
3. Implement proper error handling for API calls
4. Add proper loading states for all async operations
5. Implement proper form validation messages
6. Consider code splitting for larger bundle size reduction

The application is now cleaner and ready for deployment.
